# S3BucketWebsitesUpdates

The project aims to create a static website hosted on AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and HTML for website content. AWS S3 provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting static websites with high availability.

Technologies Used:

AWS S3: For hosting the static website content.
Terraform: For provisioning and managing AWS resources.
HTML: For creating the static website content.
Optionally, you might use Route 53 for DNS management and CloudFront for content delivery and SSL termination.

Project Steps:

Setup AWS Credentials:

Configure AWS CLI or set environment variables for AWS credentials to allow Terraform to authenticate with AWS.
Initialize Terraform:

Create a new Terraform project directory.
Initialize Terraform in the project directory using terraform init.
Write Terraform Configuration:

Create a .tf file (e.g., main.tf) to define AWS resources.
Define an S3 bucket resource for hosting the website content.
Configure the bucket for static website hosting and specify the index document (index.html) and error document (error.html).
Optionally, configure bucket policy to allow public access to the website content.
Write HTML Content:

Create HTML files (e.g., index.html, error.html) for the website content.
Customize HTML files as per your website requirements, including content, styling, and scripting.
Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform:

Run terraform plan to preview the changes Terraform will make.
Run terraform apply to apply the Terraform configuration and provision the S3 bucket.
Upload HTML Content to S3 Bucket:

Use AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to upload HTML files to the S3 bucket.
Ensure that the uploaded HTML files are marked as public so that they are accessible over the internet.
Access the Static Website:

Once the HTML files are uploaded and the bucket is configured, access the static website using the S3 bucket URL or a custom domain if configured.
Optional Steps (DNS and CloudFront):

If desired, configure Route 53 to point a custom domain to the S3 bucket.
Optionally, configure CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket to enable CDN (Content Delivery Network) and SSL termination for enhanced performance and security.
Conclusion:

By following these steps, you'll have successfully created a static website hosted on AWS S3 using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and HTML for website content. This setup provides a scalable, cost-effective, and reliable solution for hosting static websites on AWS infrastructure.
